    <h1>Getting started:</h1>

    Here are the steps to get started with shapy.js:
    
    1. Download the code from the github repository.
    2. In the head of your html page, add the following two lines in order:  
        <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script defer src="shapy.js" ></script>
    
        The first is to include jquery and the second is to include shapy.js
    
    3.  In your javascript file, add this line at the top:
        const shapy = new Shapy()
    
        Now you can call all of shapy's methods using the new shapy object.
    
        Ex:
    
        const shapy = new Shapy()
        const element = document.querySelector(".elem")
        const elementRotate = shapy.rotateable(element)
    
    4. Now just include your javascript file in your html file after the line including shapy.js, and you're all set!
